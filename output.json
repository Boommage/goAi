	{"paragraph":"Skylanders is a toys-to-life action-adventure video game franchise published by Activision.[1][2] Skylanders games are played by placing a character's figure on the \"Portal of Power\", a device that reads its tag using NFC and \"imports\" them into the game as a playable character, leveling them up and saving its progress on the figure to potentially be used on a different game or video game console with all its saved stats. Skylander figures are sold separately from the game itself unless you buy the starter pack. Typically, the starter pack for each game contains two or more Skylanders, a Portal of Power, the game disc and sometimes something else to show off the game's newest feature.\n"},
	{"paragraph":"The games take place in the Skylands, a realm of floating islands located at the center of the universe that is often threatened by evil forces who seek to rule it and gain access to all worlds.[3] For generations, a band of heroes known as the Skylanders have worked with the Portal Masters to defend Skylands from evil and protect the Core of Light. The player, who is considered to be a Portal Master, commands the Skylanders to stop Kaos and other evil threats. Each Skylander is associated with one of ten elements: Earth, Air, Fire, Water, Magic, Tech, Life, Undead, Light, and Dark. The console versions of each game follow identical storylines, while the Nintendo 3DS versions have different stories.\n"},
	{"paragraph":"Spyro's Adventure is the first game in the series and features 32 Skylanders, four for each of the eight elements. The Skylanders seek to restore the Core of Light, which Kaos destroyed, by collecting the Eternal Sources of each element and other components. \n"},
	{"paragraph":"Giants is the second installment in the series and a direct sequel to Spyro's Adventure. It introduces a new team of Skylanders called the Giants, who were canonically the first Skylanders assembled to stop the Arkeyans' reign and are strong enough to lift, throw, and destroy trees and rocks. They must stop Kaos after he reactivates the Arkeyan Conquertron and attempts to take over Skylands by resurrecting the Arkeyans.\n"},
	{"paragraph":"Swap Force is the third installment in the franchise and takes place in another part of Skylands called the Cloudbreak Islands. It introduces a new group of Skylanders called the Swap Force, who have the ability to swap their top and bottom halves and abilities. Together, the Swap Force and the Skylanders fight to prevent Kaos and his mother from ruining the performance on Mount Cloudbreak.\n"},
	{"paragraph":"Trap Team is the fourth installment in the franchise. It introduces two new elements, the Light and Dark elements, as well as the Trap Masters and the Trap mechanic. This mechanic allows players to trap special in-game enemies in element-specific Elemental Traps, which are shards of Traptanium. The trapped enemies can then be summoned as playable characters for a limited time, but can be used freely in the main hub. The Skylanders and the Trap Masters fight to stop Kaos and the Doom Raiders.\n"},
	{"paragraph":"SuperChargers is the fifth installment in the series. It introduces a new group of Skylanders called the SuperChargers, who pilot special vehicles of the Land, Sky and Sea. The Skylanders must stop Kaos, who has used The Darkness's power to create The Sky Eater, and The Darkness, which has its own plans. SuperChargers also featured a multiplayer racing game mode, very similar to the Mario Kart games. This racing game mode, however, is near impossible to play with other players (in 2024) The Nintendo console versions feature Donkey Kong and Bowser as Turbo Charge Donkey Kong and Hammer Slam Bowser, along with their respective vehicles, the Barrel Blaster and Clown Cruiser. These figures and vehicles can only be scanned and used in-game on Skylanders: SuperChargers (Racing) and Skylanders: Imaginators on Nintendo hardware. The characters, but not their vehicles, also functioned as amiibo figures. The Wii and 3DS versions of the game, titled Skylanders: SuperChargers Racing, focus on racing and feature the SuperChargers competing in a race sponsored by Pandergast to win a snow globe which will grant one wish. SuperChargers was the last game to be released on tablets.\n"},
	{"paragraph":"Imaginators is the sixth installment in the series, which was developed by Toys for Bob.[4] It was released on October 13, 2016, in Australia and New Zealand, on October 14, 2016, in Europe and on October 16, 2016, in North America.[5] It was the only game in the series released for the Nintendo Switch. It allows players to create and customize their own Skylanders called Imaginators and train them under the Senseis. The Skylanders must stop Kaos, who is using mind magic to create Doomlanders with help from an ancient Brain.  Crash Bandicoot and Doctor Neo Cortex make guest appearances as playable characters, marking their first appearance in a video game since Crash Bandicoot Nitro Kart 2 in 2010.[6] Their figures were initially exclusive to the PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 4 starter packs, but were later released as a stand-alone double pack. \n"},
	{"paragraph":"In 2011, Activision released Skylanders Universe, an online browser-based multiplayer game that allowed players to interact in Skylands, play minigames, customize their own island, and log their Skylanders collection. Players could connect their portals to their computer to summon their Skylanders, like in the core series. The service has since been discontinued.\n"},
	{"paragraph":"Activision released spin-off games on mobile devices,[7] including Cloud Patrol, Battlegrounds, Lost Islands, Collection Vault, mobile ports of Trap Team and SuperChargers, Battlecast, and Ring of Heroes.\n"},
	{"paragraph":"Launching Skylanders cost Activision $100 million or more, roughly as much as making, manufacturing and marketing a title such as Call of Duty.[8]\n"},
	{"paragraph":"As the Skylanders franchise has been released on numerous platforms, with various versions developed by different developers, there are significant differences between them.\n"},
	{"paragraph":"The most notable differences are found in the Nintendo 3DS versions, which have unique stories and gameplay more focused on platforming. Additionally, they use a separate, smaller portal that communicates via the console's infrared. In the first two games, players had to \"load\" two figures, and were able to swap between them at any time using the touch screen until a new Skylander is loaded to replace them. Beginning with Swap Force, every figure scanned is permanently saved into the game. In Trap Team, villains are captured using the touch screen instead of using real-life traps, which the 3DS portal does not support.\n"},
	{"paragraph":"The first two games were developed with the Nintendo Wii in mind, with the HD versions being ports with slightly enhanced graphics. In contrast, starting with Swap Force, the games were developed for the HD consoles, with the Wii version having heavily downgraded graphics. In addition, Superchargers on Wii and 3DS was a distinct game titled Superchargers Racing, which only included the racing portions. Imaginators skipped these two consoles entirely.\n"},
	{"paragraph":"While portals are typically interchangeable between platforms, the Xbox 360 and Xbox One versions of the game require their own portal respectively due to restrictions imposed by Microsoft.\n"},
	{"paragraph":"The Nintendo Switch version of Imaginators does not use the Portal of Power; instead, the figures are scanned using the NFC on the game controller. Similar to the 3DS versions of the previous games, scanned figures are saved and can be switched through a menu. Traps are not supported, and Vehicles only unlock Imaginite Chests.\n"},
	{"paragraph":"Lorne Balfe composed the soundtracks for the games, while Hans Zimmer composed part of Spyro’s Adventure’s main theme.[9] Imaginators does not use an original soundtrack, instead using music from previous games.\n"},
	{"paragraph":"Cavan Scott wrote a series of books, beginning with Skylanders: The Machine of Doom, which takes place before the events of Spyro's Adventure. He would later write the Skylanders: The Mask of Power series, which also serves as a prequel to Spyro's Adventure. Another series, Skylanders: Book of Elements, focuses on two elements in each installment, with Shubrik Bros. Creative writing the first and Barry Hutchson writing the second.\n"},
	{"paragraph":"Two art books, Strata: The Art of Skylanders: Swap Force and Clutch: The Art of Skylanders: Superchargers, were produced by Vicarious Visions. As employee exclusives, the only way to obtain them is through online sellers or charity events.\n"},
	{"paragraph":"IDW Publishing created a comic series associated with the Skylanders franchise which takes place in between games.[10] The series was reportedly cancelled to avoid conflicting with Skylanders Academy, which used a different canon.\n"},
	{"paragraph":"In 2016, it was announced that Activision Blizzard Studios would produce an animated television series based on Skylanders.[11] The first season debuted on Netflix on October 28, 2016, the second season on October 6, 2017, and the third and final season premiered on September 28, 2018.[12][13] On April 30, 2019, it was announced that Skylanders Academy was cancelled.[14]\n"},
	{"paragraph":"Activision has commented on the possibility of a movie based on Skylanders.[15] On May 6, 2014, Activision CEO Eric Hirshberg announced that the Activision team had an interest in \"jumping on the film adaptation bandwagon\" and adapting Skylanders into a film.[16]\n"},
	{"paragraph":"Following the release of Imaginators, the franchise went into hiatus, with speculations surrounding a seventh console installment. Nevertheless, future projects within the Skylanders universe were limited to the recent mobile game titled Ring of Heroes until its closure in 2022. The studios worked on other unrelated games until Activision Blizzard was acquired by Microsoft in January 2022. Activision CEO Bobby Kotick stated that Microsoft had interest in reviving some of the old studios' hit franchises, including Guitar Hero and Skylanders.[17]\n"},
